                      <div class='cardRules  card--crumpled'><div class = 'cardT'><div class = 'cardT'><p>&#x25CF; Closest Sunday to the start of the season that is not Thanksgiving.</p></div><div class = 'cardT'><p>&#x25CF; By reverse order of the finish of the preceding DaWiz (initially by the draw of cards). 
Based on those standings owners get to choose their draft position for the current DaWiz (owner in last position gets first choice, owner in first position gets last choice). We will attempt to replace Owner-Dropouts and their draft order will be assumed by a new owner. See 10 for standings criteria.</p></div><div class = 'cardT'><p>&#x25CF; 2 centres, 2 left wingers, 2 right wingers, 2 defensemen for every team</p><p>Positions are officially determined from the Bible (taken from NHL.com).</p><p>&#x25CF; No goalies (the Jim Carlaw Rule)</p></div><div class = 'cardT'><p>&#x25CF; The cost of a freebee is determined by the following formula: cost = ((number of Owners x 16)+1 - draft position) / 100.  For 12 owners it will run down from $1.92 for selection #1.</p><p>&#x25CF;  A freebee does not count towards the position assignment required on draft day.  Once the owner’s positional requirements are fulfilled (normally at the end of the draft) the player assumes his bible position.</p></div><div class = 'cardT'><p>&#x25CF; Due to the potential of certain first rounders, their cost has been based on the average price of the other top first rounders.</p><p>&#x25CF; Impact players, other than first rounders, may have cost adjustments made, with the agreement of all teams, before the drafting begins.</p></div><div class = 'cardT'><p>&#x25CF; Only one player can be slotted.</p><p>&#x25CF; Slotted player has to be from your October team from previous year - no bench players, or drop/pick 3rd rounders.  Check ‘Last October’s Teams’ on the web page under ‘Other Stuff’ for your team.</p><p>&#x25CF; The slotted player moves 3 rounds up.  Drafted 8th round last year goes to 5th round this year.  Thus only players from found 4 through 16 are eligible.</p><p>The slotted player (above $1.70) will cost a 15% premium over current bible cost, players below $1.70 will have $0.25 added to the player cost.  The minimum cost will be $0.25.</p><p>&#x25CF; Slotting is done before the first round picks.</p><p>&#x25CF; A player must have a bible cost (this year) in order to be slotted.</p><p>&#x25CF; An owner obviously passes when the slotted player position pick comes up (since he's already picked), Duh.</p></div><div class = 'cardT'><p>&#x25CF; Each team owner can have eight (8) players on their bench.</p>
