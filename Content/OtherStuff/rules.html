                      <h2>General Rules and Guidelines</h2><div class='cardRules  card--crumpled'><h3>1.  Draft Date <h3><p>&#x25CF; Closest Sunday to the start of the season that is not Thanksgiving.</p></div><div class = 'cardT'><h3>2.  Drafting position. <h3><p>&#x25CF; By reverse order of the finish of the preceding DaWiz (initially by the draw of cards). 
Based on those standings owners get to choose their draft position for the current DaWiz (owner in last position gets first choice, owner in first position gets last choice). We will attempt to replace Owner-Dropouts and their draft order will be assumed by a new owner. See 10 for standings criteria.</p></div><div class = 'cardT'><h3>3.   Positional Requirements<h3><p>&#x25CF; 2 centres, 2 left wingers, 2 right wingers, 2 defensemen for every team</p><p>Positions are officially determined from the Bible (taken from NHL.com).</p><p>&#x25CF; No goalies (the Jim Carlaw Rule)</p></div><div class = 'cardT'><h3>4.   Freebees<h3><p>&#x25CF; The cost of a freebee is determined by the following formula: cost = ((number of Owners x 16)+1 - draft position) / 100.  For 12 owners it will run down from $1.92 for selection #1.</p><p>&#x25CF;  A freebee does not count towards the position assignment required on draft day.  Once the owner’s positional requirements are fulfilled (normally at the end of the draft) the player assumes his bible position.</p></div><div class = 'cardT'><h3>5. Exception to Freebees Cost Formula<h3><p>&#x25CF; Due to the potential of certain first rounders, their cost has been based on the average price of the other top first rounders.</p><p>&#x25CF; Impact players, other than first rounders, may have cost adjustments made, with the agreement of all teams, before the drafting begins.</p></div><div class = 'cardT'><h3>6.  Slotted Players<h3><p>&#x25CF; Only one player can be slotted.</p><p>&#x25CF; Slotted player has to be from your October team from previous year - no bench players, or drop/pick 3rd rounders.  Check ‘Last October’s Teams’ on the web page under ‘Other Stuff’ for your team.</p><p>&#x25CF; The slotted player moves 3 rounds up.  Drafted 8th round last year goes to 5th round this year.  Thus only players from found 4 through 16 are eligible.</p><p>The slotted player (above $1.70) will cost a 15% premium over current bible cost, players below $1.70 will have $0.25 added to the player cost.  The minimum cost will be $0.25.</p><p>&#x25CF; Slotting is done before the first round picks.</p><p>&#x25CF; A player must have a bible cost (this year) in order to be slotted.</p><p>&#x25CF; An owner obviously passes when the slotted player position pick comes up (since he's already picked), Duh.</p></div><div class = 'cardT'><h3>7.   Bench Players<h3><p>&#x25CF; Each team owner can have eight (8) players on their bench.</p><p>&#x25CF; The benches are to be submitted after the 16th round on draft night unless there is agreement otherwise.</p><p>&#x25CF; There will be a cut-off cost, determined prior to the bench submissions, over which any undrafted player is deemed ineligible for the benches.</p></div><div class = 'cardT'><h3>8.   Drop/Pick Rules<h3><p>Date:  Closest Sunday to when ½ of all the seasons’ games have been played (e.g. 615 games).  Standings (for the purposes of half time money and drop/pick positioning) are those determined on the morning following the 615th played game.</p><p>&#x25CF; Round 1   - any player off your bench.  If you pass Round 1, you can not make a selection in Round 2, however you are eligible for a selection for Round 3. </p><p>&#x25CF; Round 2    - any player off your bench</p><p>&#x25CF; Round 3 - any player not on an “active” team whose cost is less than a predetermined amount (currently $2.50).  All unpicked bench players are eligible for the 3rd round.</p><p>&#x25CF; A player dropped by an owner is ineligible for pick up by another owner (the Phil Ross Rule)</p><p>&#x25CF; You must maintain your team positional requirements after each round.</p></div><div class = 'cardT'><h3>9.  DaWiz standings are determined based on:<h3><p>&#x25CF; Total points (H to L)</p><p>&#x25CF; Points per game (H to L)</p><p>&#x25CF; Goals (H to L)</p><p>&#x25CF; Games played (L to H)</p></div><div class = 'cardT'><h3>Playoff Pool Rules:<h3><p>&#x25CF; Your playoff team consists of a maximum of 30 players.</p><p>&#x25CF; Only the top 25 players count in your overall total points.</p><p>&#x25CF; Your team consists of a max of 15 of your own players and 15 from anyone else's team or form the pool of undrafted players.</p><p>&#x25CF; We pay prizes for 1st, 2nd and 3rd only in the proportion of 50%, 35% and 15%.</p><p>&#x25CF; Goalies are ineligible for the playoff pool.  Other than that there is no position requirement.</p><h3>Your Playoff Team<h3><p>&#x25CF; Any player in the season who has ever appeared under your name.  That means the players drafted in October, those put on your bench at the beginning of the year and any 3rd round drop/pick selection selected from the pool of previously undrafted players.  If you can't find 15 players eligible for the playoffs then you are going into the pool short-handed.</p><p>&#x25CF; Each owner has one highly placed unique player, the selection of which is automatic.  You may not choose the earliest round placed player from each team who plays for a playoff bound NHL team (regardless if they are chosen on that person's playoff team or not).</p><p>&#x25CF; The 'uniques' are defined as above with no exceptions.  Normally your first rounder is your unique if his NHL team makes the playoffs (regardless of injury, suspension or expected team playoff performance).  If the first rounder doesn't make the playoffs then the unique is the second rounder etc. down the list until a unique is determined.</p><p>&#x25CF; The unique is defined by the end-of-the-year team.  That means if you replaced your 1st rounder with a player from your bench at drop/pick, the former bench player is your unique if his team makes the playoffs.</p></div></div>
