            <h3>2. Drafting Position</h3>
            <p>&#x25CF; By reverse order of the finish of the preceding DaWiz (initially by the draw of cards).</p>
            <p>&#x25CF; Based on those standings, owners get to choose their draft position for the current DaWiz (owner in last position gets first choice, owner in first position gets last choice).</p>
            <p>&#x25CF; We will attempt to replace owner dropouts, and their draft order will be assumed by a new owner. See 10 for standings criteria.</p>
